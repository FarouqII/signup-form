# Signup Form

This project demonstrates my understanding and application of core front-end development concepts, including responsive layout, form validation, and custom design elements.

## Applied Skills

- **HTML**: Structuring a semantic and accessible form layout.
- **CSS**: Styling the form with modern techniques such as Flexbox and responsive design. I also implemented transitions and animations to enhance the visual experience.
- **JavaScript**: Handling basic client-side form validation and interactivity.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the form adapts gracefully to different screen sizes.
- **Design and Animation**: I created the website's **logo** and **animated owl illustration** entirely by myself to give the project a unique and personal touch.

## Purpose

This project was an opportunity to combine visual creativity with front-end functionality.
